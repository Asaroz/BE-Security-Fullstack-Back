# BE-Security-Fullstack-Back

This is an example app demonstrating a backend that includes endpoints for user registration, login and a test endpoint that requires authentication.

# Usage

- `npm i`     ; Install dependencies from package.json
- `npm start` ; Start application with nodemon

## TODO

- add proper controllers for improved routing and clarity
- add more secured endpoints for functionality
- add a separate folder for middleware
- add validation and sanitation for *all* endpoints
