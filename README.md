# BE-Security-Fullstack-Back

This is an example app demonstrating a backend that includes endpoints for user registration, login and a test endpoint that requires authentication.

# Usage

- `npm i`     ; Install dependencies from package.json
- `npm start` ; Start application with nodemon

## TODO

- proper controllers for improved routing and clarity
- more secure endpoints for functionality
- a separate folder for middleware
